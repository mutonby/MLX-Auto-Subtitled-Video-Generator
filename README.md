## Important Note

⚠️ This application is designed to run on Apple Silicon (M series) Macs only. It utilizes the MLX framework, which is optimized for Apple's custom chips.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- An Apple Silicon (M series) Mac
- Conda package manager

If you don't have Conda installed on your Mac, you can follow the [Ultimate Guide to Installing Miniforge for AI Development on M1 Macs](https://www.rayfernando.ai/ultimate-guide-installing-miniforge-ai-development-m1-macs) for a comprehensive setup process.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/RayFernando1337/MLX-Auto-Subtitled-Video-Generator.git;
   cd MLX-Auto-Subtitled-Video-Generator
   ```

2. Create a new Conda environment with Python 3.12:
   ```
   conda create -n mlx-whisper python=3.12;
   conda activate mlx-whisper
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   xcode-select --install
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Install FFmpeg (required for audio processing):
   ```
   brew install ffmpeg
   ```

   Note: If you don't have Homebrew installed, you can install it by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```
   
   After installation, follow the instructions provided in the terminal to add Homebrew to your PATH. For more information about Homebrew, visit [brew.sh](https://brew.sh/).

### Running the Application

To run the Streamlit application, use the following command:

```
streamlit run mlx_whisper_transcribe.py
```


## Features

- Upload video files (MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV)
- Transcribe videos using various Whisper models
- Generate VTT and SRT subtitle files
- Download transcripts as a ZIP file

## How It Works

1. Upload a video file
2. Choose a Whisper model
3. Click the "Transcribe" button to process the video
4. View the results and download the generated transcripts

## Models

The application supports the following Whisper models:

- Tiny (Q4)
- Large v3
- Small English (Q4)
- Small (FP32)
- Distil Large v3
- Large v3 Turbo (New!)

Each model has different capabilities and processing speeds. Experiment with different models to find the best balance between accuracy and performance for your needs.

### New Model: Large v3 Turbo

The newly added Large v3 Turbo model offers significant performance improvements:

- Transcribes 12 minutes in 14 seconds on an M2 Ultra (~50X faster than real time)
- Significantly smaller than the Large v3 model (809M vs 1550M)
- It is multilingual

This model is particularly useful for processing longer videos or when you need quick results without sacrificing too much accuracy.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, please check the following:

- Ensure you're using an Apple Silicon Mac
- Verify that all dependencies are correctly installed
- Check the console output for any error messages

For any persistent problems, please open an issue in the repository.
